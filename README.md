# TableFinder-Laravel

A school project of a website used for finding groups or players for tabletop games.  
There's a contact form for the admin, everything is sent using ajax after which the messages are stored in the database.  
The page Tables contains some information about the table, such as when they'll be played, experience required, game master required, which game system the table belongs to. After clicking on "see more" the user is redirected to a single post with more information about the table, with the ability to comment on it.  
The tables are dynamic, there's pagination, filters and the ability to sort them.  
The user's profile gets a default picture which they are able to change later on, and they can add some information about themselves and their preferred roles(player or game master). They can see their own listings as well as their comments left on other posts.  
The admin page is entirely done with ajax, they can see user activity that's pulled from a log.txt file, with information such as log-ins, log-outs, profile editing, making/editing/deleting posts or comments. There's a list of users, tables, comments, game systems, "ads"(which I mostly added so I could put in a slider somewhere), social media, and they're allowed CRUD operations on all of them.
